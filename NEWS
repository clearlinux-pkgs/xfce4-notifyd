  Features:
    * Added man page for xfce4-notifyd-config from Evgeni Golov.
    * Support the 'reason' parameter of the NotificationChanged signal.
      Note that if you are using libnotify 0.4.4 or older, this will
      cause memory leaks in *applications* that use libnotify (not in
      xfce4-notifyd).  In this case, you should compile xfce4-notifyd
      passing the --enable-old-notification-closed-signature switch
      to configure.
    * Add summary-bold style property to allow themes to set the
      summary field of the notification bold (bug 5773).
    * Add the spec_version parameter to the GetServerInformation method.
      This behavior can be disabled by passing the
      --enable-old-get-server-information-signature flag to
      configure (bug 5602).
    * Make notifications unmovable (Jérôme Guelfucci, bug 5248).
    * Implement support for icon-only notifications (Canonical
      extension).
    * Implement support for "gauge" notifications (Canonical extension).
    * Added proper placement of notifications so they don't overlap when
      there are multiple on the screen.  This also uses a custom workarea
      calculation to avoid placing notifications where docked windows have
      set struts (Jérôme Guelfucci, bug 5248).
    * Port to libxfce4ui, drop libxfcegui4 dep (Romain Bouvier, bug 6375).
    * Add a preview button to the preferences dialog.

  Bugfixes:
    * Use correct COPYING file (GPLv2, not GPLv3).
    * Fix ugliness with rounded corners on windows sometimes, both with
      compositing enabled and disabled.
    * Check for exo-csource at configure time when needed (bug 5783).
    * Check for dbus-binding-tool at configure time.
